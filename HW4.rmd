# Create Times Series
```{r}

plot(IPV_ts)
Acf(IPV_ts)
ggseasonplot(IPV_ts)
# Based on the Acf graph, the conclusion I could draw is that my time series don't have a trend and seasonality because when the lag goes up the auto-correlation does not goes down to 0. After lag 16, the auto correlation gose negative. As a result, my time series does not have a trend. It also dose not have the seasonality because we can't see a clear signal(pattern) in the Acf graph. From my seasonal plot, at the same month of each year, we are not sure whether it increases or decreases.It is random because the bars go to zero rapidly.It is not stationary because the Acf did not converge to zero.

#take Mean of all available history

MA5_forecast <- ma(IPV_ts,order=5)
Acf(MA5_forecast)
lines(MA5_forecast,col="pink")
MA9_forecast <- ma(IPV_ts,order=9)
Acf(MA9_forecast)
lines(MA9_forecast,col="blue")
# For moving average method, we choose two orders. Order 5 focuses more on the recent data of that period so it's more responsive. Order 9 focuses more on historical data so it's more smoothing than Order 5. For both Acf, no tread or seasonality for both model. And not stationary. It is random because the bars go to zero rapidly.
